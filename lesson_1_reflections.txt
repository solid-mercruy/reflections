How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
You can find the bug by comparing two versions side by side

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you can track the problem from the point it has started

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Having commits manually will let you make reasonable commits while auto savings make too many versions without a good purpose. The bright side of auto saving is that in
 case of physical loss, you always have a backup of the changes you have made.

 Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 VCS's like Git are made to keep track of changes that are related somehow, while google docs is used for singular files where are separate from other files.

 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
 by using the command "git log" followed by file name, you can see the history of the commits on that file. by using the command "git diff" followed by two commits'
 version code, you can see the differences between two commits.

 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 by using version control systems, you always have access to the old versions of your work, so you don't need to be worried about losing a working version.
